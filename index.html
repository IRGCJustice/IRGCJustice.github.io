Dear Minister,

I am addressing you with respect to classifying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (“IRGC”), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, as a terrorist organization.

Founded shortly after the Iranian Revolution on 22 April 1979 by the order of Ayatollah Khomeini, IRGC has grown into a giant organization that has, through its wide-spread arms, preempted and distorted Iran’s military, cultural, economic, policymaking, and diplomatic landscape. More and beyond squashing any deviating opinions at home and fueling several terrorist groups and entities abroad, IRGC has directly engaged in attacking and killing hundreds of civilians, including children, inside and outside Iran, aimed at intimating protests, saving a fellow tyrant here or destabilizing an “unfriendly” government there.
As the IRGC’s role in funding and direct support of Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups in the MENA region is relatively well investigated, we try to draw your attention to some of IRGC’s recent terrorist activities in Iran and Europe:

-	IRGC in Iran
o	Green Movement
Following the government’s, including IRGC’s, full-scale manipulation of the results from the 2009 presidential election, clashes broke out between police and the protesters the very next day after the election, 13 June 2009. On 15 June 2009, millions of Iranians defied the security forces and the admonitions of top officials and flooded into the streets. The protests were spreading, and the slogans were reaching beyond the election results. 
As Khamenei, the head of government,  felt uncomfortable with protests pointing at him, IRGC stepped in for an even more brutal suppression: beating the protesters back off the streets, arresting at least 4,000 and killing at least 112 civilians, staging show trials, rounding up leaders, and sentencing activists to lengthy prison terms. Hossein Hamedani, then the IRGC commander in Tehran, later reported on the IRGC’s crucial role in the suppression of the 2009 protests. Later he served in Syria as both an advisor to the Syrian army during the Syrian Civil War and as an overseer for Quds Force operations in support of the Syrian government.

o	Bloody November. 
Ten years later, when the government was struggling with extreme corruption and pressures from the revival of US embargos, another wave of protests erupted after a Nov. 15 announcement on state media that gas prices would rise by as much as 200%.
What began as scattered protests quickly spread into one of the biggest challenges to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
On the evening of November 15, NetBlocks reported significant disruption and ultimately a near-total block of Iran’s internet. On November 18, Iran’s telecom minister confirmed that the national security council ordered the internet shutdown.
On November 18, IRNA (the government’s official news agency) reported that IRGC forces arrested 150 leaders of the unrest. On the same day, the IRGC announced in a statement that, “If needed, its forces will respond to the continuing unrest in a decisive and revolutionary manner.”
Iranian authorities deployed lethal force at a far quicker pace from the start than in other protests in recent years, according to activists and details revealed by authorities.
Khamenei turned to his elite forces to put down the recent unrest - the Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij religious militia.
A senior member of the Revolutionary Guards in Kermanshah province said that the provincial Governor handed down instructions at a late-night emergency meeting at his office on 18 November.
“We had orders from top officials in Tehran to end the protests”, the Guards member said, recounting the governor’s talk.
The U.S. State Department has said it has received videos of the Revolutionary Guards opening fire without warning on protesters in Mahshahr, and that when protesters fled to nearby marshlands, the Guards pursued them and surrounded them with machine guns mounted on trucks, spraying the protesters with bullets and killing at least 100 people. 
Amnesty International reported that "according to credible reports ... at least 304 people were killed and thousands injured between 15 and 18 November". According to a Reuters report, about 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on 15 November. The toll, provided to Reuters by three Iranian interior ministry officials, included at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as some members of the security forces and police.
On 3 December that year, a report on Iran’s state television confirmed that security forces had fatally shot citizens.

o	Woman, Life, Freedom.
  The ongoing series of protests and civil unrest against the government of Iran began on 16 September 2022 with one important slogan in its center: Woman, Life, Freedom. From the very beginning of the peaceful protests, the IRGC and its branches, especially the Basij militia, have been actively and directly involved in killing hundreds of people, including children. The suppression has been especially brutal in regions with Sunni, Kurd, and Baluch minorities. On 30 September, when hundreds of Baluchs started a protest rally shortly after the Friday public prayer in Zahedan with regards to a reported rape of a 15-year-old girl by the head of the police department, the police and IRGC forces opened lethal fire on them by use of battle ammunition.  According to human rights activists, only in one day were 100 Baluchs brutally murdered. 
In another escalated crackdown in Kurdish areas of Iran, the government took revenge for Kurds active participation in the call for national protests and strikes on 15, 16, and 17 November. A hardliner Iranian lawmaker and former IRGC commander, Mohammad Esmail Kowsari, confirmed that the Revolutionary Guard’s Ground Forces have been deployed to Kurdish areas to crack down on protesters, during which dozens were shot dead. In the early hours of 21 November, IRGC targeted the headquarters of "dissident groups" in Iraqi Kurdistan for the second time in an attempt to eradicate Kurdish parties who, according to Iran officials, incite Iranian Kurd separatists. At least 18 people, including women and children, fell dead in these attacks. 

-	IRGC in Europe
A report from February 2019 published by the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center investigating Iranian terrorist plots in Europe, demonstrates that the use of terrorism is a normal “political tool”  for the mullahs’ regime to advance and protect its interests, and also raises serious questions for the policymakers in Europe to engage in meaningful review of the past policy which has failed to prevent the regime’s use of terrorism in European soil. After bringing numerous examples of Iran government’s terrorist plots and operations in Europe, the report concludes that the Iranian regime, acting directly by its own means (MOIS, IRGC, Quds Force) or indirectly through “proxy organizations” (Hezbollah and others) organized or tried to organize hundreds of terrorist attacks in the last forty years, not only in the Persian Gulf area and in the Middle East but also in Europe, the United States, Asia, and Africa. According to the authors, “[t]his was not only the case at the very beginning of the “Islamic Revolution” when the situation was not yet politically stabilized in Iran: the list we draw up demonstrates that there is a systematic trend in Iranian policy to resort to terror when the regime thinks it could support its strategic ambitions or reinforce its power by crushing the opposition. 

In light of all said above, which were only a few examples of many, I believe that IRGC is a heightened international threat to universal humanitarian values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the Union is founded.  I, therefore, urge you to kindly consider and actively pursue the following matters with utmost urgency:
•	that the COMET working party take immediate actions to recommend renewal of the EU Terrorist List to the Council with a view to listing IRGC;
•	that you, as an honored member of the Council, engage in classifying IRGC as a terrorist organization;
•	that effective measures are taken in order to freeze all IRGC’s direct and indirect funds, financial operations, and assets within the EU; and
•	that effective measures are pursued in order to identify and cut IRGC’s lobbying, propaganda, and repression arms in the EU.
I appreciate your solidarity with all victims of terror and their families. I appreciate your humane support which could save many more innocent souls of, among others, children.
